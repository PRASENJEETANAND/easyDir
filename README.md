# How to Run the Program on Windows (For Non-Coders)

This guide will help you install everything needed and run the program with just a double-click.

## Step 1: Downloading Python 3.10.6

- Open your web browser and go to: [Python 3.10.6 Download Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/)
- Click on **"Windows Installer (64-bit)"** to download.

## Step 2: Installing Python 3.10.6

- Open the downloaded file.
- Check the box for **"Add Python to PATH"** (this is important).
- Click **"Install Now"** and wait for the installation to complete.
- Restart your computer.
- To verify the installation:
  - Press `Windows + R` on your keyboard.
  - Type `cmd` and press Enter.
  - The Command Prompt window will open.
  - Type:  
    ```sh
    python --version
    ```
  - It should display: `Python 3.10.6`

## Step 3: Installing Required Dependencies

- Press `Windows + R` on your keyboard.
- Type `cmd` and press Enter.
- The Command Prompt window will open.
- Type the following command and press Enter:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas PyQt5 PySide6
  ```
- Wait for the installation to complete.

## Step 4: Running the Program

- Open the program folder.
- Double-click the **"RUN_APP_FROM_HERE.bat"** file.
- The program will start automatically.

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

- If nothing happens when you run the `.bat` file, restart your computer and try again.
- If you get a Python error, make sure you installed **Python 3.10.6** correctly.
- If a module error appears, manually install dependencies by running:
  ```sh
  pip install pandas PyQt5 PySide6
  ```
- If the `.bat` file still doesn’t work, try running it manually in Command Prompt:
  - Open the program folder.
  - Hold **Shift + Right-click** inside the folder.
  - Click **"Open Command Prompt here"** or **"Open PowerShell window here."**
  - Type:
    ```sh
    RUN_APP_FROM_HERE.bat
    ```
  - Press Enter.
